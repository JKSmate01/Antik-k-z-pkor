# Antik középkor projekt
The project started around 20th of april. My teammate was Erik. Firt we created a Trello workspace and we listed all the things we would need to do. The website contains 8 HTML file, 2 CSS file, around 40 image and a bootstrap 5 plugin. 

The website’s desing was made in Figma. The HTML and CSS code was written by me and Erik. We used Visual Studios’s / Visual Code’s Live Share to collaborate in code writing. Most of the images were chosen by Erik and I implemented them into the sites.
